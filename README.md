# ESG Sentiment Analysis Study and Greenwashing Risk

**ESG Greenwashing Detection via NLP**<br>
<br>
**Objective:** <br>
This study evaluates ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance and public perception across industries, with a focus on identifying and quantifying greenwashing risks.<br>

**Goals:**
- Identify key sustainability themes across industries<br>
- Assess greenwashing potential by sector<br>
- Measure greenwashing through media sentiment analysis<br>

**Methodology:** <br>
Natural Language Processing techniques were applied to ESG reports and news articles, including:<br>
- Word Cloud Analysis to surface dominant ESG themes<br>
- WordNet Expansion for semantic enrichment<br>
- TF-IDF to rank term relevance across documents<br>
- Sentiment Analysis to gauge public perception<br>
- Greenwashing Detection using custom rule-based and statistical models<br>

**Outcome:** <br>
The project delivers a comparative ESG risk profile across industries, highlighting discrepancies between corporate disclosures and public sentiment. This supports stakeholders in identifying sectors with elevated greenwashing exposure and informs more transparent sustainability reporting.
<br>

**Insights from the Study:**<br>
Each industry emphasizes distinct ESG pillars, but aspirational language, especially in Pharma and Oil & Gas strongly indicates greenwashing risk. News media tends to be neutral, masking promotional tones in ESG reports.
